## Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> It is very difficult for the users to which parameter to put in order to find the result which is one of the drawback of this webpage design. For example, to find 
   a particular city, use have to go through the entire table in oreder to find the analysis.
-> A way to address this would be to present drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields. Each list would need to update after a parameter      is selected in any filter.
-> It is also a good idea if there is reset button for the filter. It should be located below the last filter button.
